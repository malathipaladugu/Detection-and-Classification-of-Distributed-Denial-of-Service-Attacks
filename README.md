 Detection-and-Classification-of-Distributed-Denial-of-Service-Attacks
------------------------------------------------------------------------

DDoS attack classification is done using 4 different ML algorithms, XGboost, SGD, KNN, Naive Bayeâ€™s
Among the four algorithms, the highest accuracy of 97.24% was achieved with XGBoost, while the lowest
accuracy of 86.12% was observed with Naive Bayes. The remaining two algorithms, SGD and KNN, had
accuracy values of 90.02% and 95.76%, respectively.
